**Output hdf5** files together with the corresponding config files used to run each of the cities can be found there. E.g. the background production of deconvoluted hits (``cdst``) can be found in

.. code-block:: text

  /lustre/neu/data4/NEXT/NEXTNEW/MC/Background/NEXT_v1_05_02_NEXUS_v5_07_01_bkg_v9/cdst/output

Where the following **config** files have been used,

.. code-block:: text

  /lustre/neu/data4/NEXT/NEXTNEW/MC/Background/NEXT_v1_05_02_NEXUS_v5_07_01_bkg_v9/cdst/conf


.. note::
  It is important to stress some aspects regarding the production:
    * The production is based on the v9 version of the background model. The details of the model can be found `here <https://next.ific.uv.es/cgi-bin/DocDB/private/ShowDocument?docid=182>`_.
    * The two versions of ``nexus`` (v5_07_00 and v5_07_01) are identical but for an update concerning the calibration ports.
    * The detsim package refers to the ``c++`` and ``art`` version. The repository may be found `here <https://next.ific.uv.es:8888/nextsw/detsim>`_.
    * The EventMixer package refers to the ``gate`` version. The repository may be found `here <https://next.ific.uv.es:8888/nextsw/PyToNE/blob/master/PyToNE/EventMixer.py>`_.
    * The IC package is considered in different versions since the goal is to match the official Canfranc production for data (``v1.1.0``). However, several updates implied the usage of more recent versions, even a custom one before the officialization of ``Ã¬saura``.
